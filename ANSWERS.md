- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Class components allow components to have state as well as make use of lifecycle methods.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
1.  Constructor(), is called before the component is mounted to the DOM and allows things like initial state.
2.  componentDidMount(), is called immediately after render and allows things like network requests
3.  componentWillUnmount(), is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed and allows cleanup

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
To apply non-visual behavior and stateful logic throught components 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
Testing minimizes the risk of bugs ending up in production code
